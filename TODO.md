## Task list

- Add feature to simulate a HRF signal with different parameters for two conditions, following the block design by Gervain et al. (2012).
- Look for a more elegant way to convolve overlapping signals in `convolve_signals`.
- Make a class `Params` to pas to functions, avoiding the redefinition of params.
- A plotting methods for the events and signal classes.
